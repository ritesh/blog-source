Hello! I'm Ritesh. I work in InfoSec and I enjoy building things and helping design secure, resilient systems. I have a keen interest in learning new things both in and outside my field of work. I'm pretty good at trivia and obscure facts, collected from 3AM trawls of wikipedia. If you'd like to get in touch, find me on twitter [@rsinha](https://twitter.com/rsinha).
