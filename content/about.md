Hello! I'm Ritesh Sinha. I work in information security, my job usually involves trying to break stuff to figure out how it can be made better. However, I also enjoy building things and advising organisations on how to make their systems more resilient. I like to learn new things both in and outside my field of work. I'm pretty good at trivia and obscure facts. If you'd like to contact me, find me on twitter [@rsinha](https://twitter.com/rsinha).
