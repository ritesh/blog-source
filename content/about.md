Hello! I'm Ritesh Sinha. I work in information security and my job usually involves trying to break stuff to figure out how it can be made better. However, I also enjoy building things and advising organisations on designing secure, resilient systems. I like to learn new things both in and outside my field of work. I'm pretty good at trivia and obscure facts. If you'd like to get in touch, find me on twitter [@rsinha](https://twitter.com/rsinha).
