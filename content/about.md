Hello! I'm Ritesh Sinha. I work in InfoSec and my job usually involves figuring out how to break stuff to understand how it can be made better. However, I enjoy building things and advising organisations on designing secure, resilient systems. I enjoy learning new things both in and outside my field of work. I'm pretty good at trivia and obscure facts, collected from 3AM trawls of wikipedia. If you'd like to get in touch, find me on twitter [@rsinha](https://twitter.com/rsinha).
