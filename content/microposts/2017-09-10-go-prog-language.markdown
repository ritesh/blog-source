I have too many books to read, and too little time! I'm currently making my way through [The Go Programming Language] (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-ebook/dp/B0184N7WWS/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505071377&sr=1-4) by Alan Donovan & the Brian Kernighan, slowly but steadily. I'd purchased the book a while ago, but have been reading it in bite sized chunks. I'm somewhat familiar with Go as it is fairly easy to learn and you don't have to keep fighting the compiler but it gives you excellent compile time guarantees. This makes it an easy language to pick up for someone familiar with Python (and without a software development background).

There are some aspects of the language that I don't yet fully understand and I'm always keen to improve. This book is an enjoyable introduction to the language and feels like an excellent text book on the subject - with exercises that I should probably do, at some point. I suspect that even seasoned programmers will get a lot of out it as it covers some interesting bugs from programs that are syntactically correct, but logically wrong. It is often easy to resort to stackoverflow or find a blog post about a particular issue when learning a new language and hitting a wall but it is easier to dive deep to get a better understanding, especially when you're learning a new language.
